### About

This is a tiny, slightly janky client-side mod that allows you to reposition
chest-container-type GUIs and optionally disable the dark background overlay.

The main reason for this mod is simple: sometimes you need to see what’s happening
in the center of the screen, which is normally fully covered by the GUI.
This is especially useful when working with serverside-only plugins, such as
plugins for positioning armor stands.

### Controls

* `Alt + Left Mouse Button` — move the container GUI to the cursor position
* `Shift + V` — toggle the translucent dark background. `V` can be changed in
  Key Binds settings
